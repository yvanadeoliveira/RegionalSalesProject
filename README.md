# 🎯 Regional Sales Dashboard – Mavyn Toys

Imagine you're a Business Intelligence Analyst working for a nationwide toy store chain called **Mavyn Toys**.  

Recently, the **Supervisor of Regional Sales Managers** noticed that some stores have been struggling with **stock issues** due to inventory shortages. That's when you get called in to **investigate the data** and build an insightful **dashboard**. The goal? Help each Regional Sales Manager **track trends, monitor product performance**, and identify **potential lost revenue** in their area.  

The dashboard will be **reviewed monthly** as part of the Regional Sales Strategy Meetings.  

And *that’s* how this dashboard came to life! ✨

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Journey

### ✅ STEP 1: Define the Purpose

- **Who are the end users?**  
  → Regional Sales Managers  

- **What are their goals?**  
  → Increase revenue and reduce losses caused by out-of-stock items  

- **Key questions to answer:**  
  - Is revenue trending up or down?  
  - Which product categories and items drive the most revenue?  
  - Are we losing sales due to out-of-stock items?  

- **How often is this dashboard reviewed?**  
  → Once a month

### 📊 STEP 2: Choose the Right Metrics

**Business Goal:** Increase Revenue  
- `Total Revenue`  
- `Month-over-Month Revenue Change`  
- `MoM % Revenue Change`  
- `Year-over-Year % Revenue Change`  

**Business Goal:** Minimize Lost Revenue  
- `Stock On Hand`  
- `Estimated Monthly Revenue Loss` *(calculated based on average monthly revenue for out-of-stock products)*

### 🎨 STEP 3: Present the Data Effectively

Choosing the right visuals is crucial. The layout should:
- Highlight key insights up front  
- Use simple and intuitive visuals for clarity  
- Guide the viewer through a **logical, story-driven experience**  

Remember: great dashboards **don’t just show data—they tell a story**.

---

### 🧠 STEP 4: Tie It All Together

Data means nothing without context.  
Human beings aren’t inspired by charts or graphs—they're inspired by **stories**.  

The best BI dashboards use data to:
- Tell clear, data-driven stories  
- Expose key insights  
- Inspire stakeholders to **take action**

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside the Dashboard?

- **Revenue Trends:** Track monthly revenue and compare it to both the previous month and previous year  
- **Category Impact:** See how each product category contributes to total revenue  
- **Product-Level Insights:** Identify top and bottom performing products  
- **Inventory Watchlist:** Discover out-of-stock products and how much revenue is potentially lost if they remain unavailable  

---

### 💡 Actionable Insights Examples:
- Restocking a high-performing toy that is currently out of stock could help **recover significant lost revenue**  
- A specific **product category** showed strong **MoM revenue growth**, indicating that a seasonal promotion may be driving sales  
- One regional store experienced a **YoY revenue drop**, primarily due to **inventory shortages**—this highlights the need for urgent stock replenishment

## 🧭 Usability  
This dashboard was designed with interactivity in mind, making it easy for Regional Sales Managers to explore insights relevant to their specific regions and needs.

**Slicers:**  
Use the **Region**, **Month**, and **Year** slicers at the top to filter the entire dashboard. You can select multiple values or clear selections to reset the view.

**Visual Interactions:**  
All visuals are connected. For example, clicking on a product category bar will automatically update the revenue trend, product-level revenue, and lost revenue tables accordingly.

**Callout Labels:**  
Key insights — such as highest-performing categories, estimated revenue loss from out-of-stock items, and color-coded highlights — make it easy to spot areas needing attention.

This ensures the dashboard not only presents data clearly but empowers users to take action through a smooth and intuitive experience.
