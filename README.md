# ðŸŽ¯ Regional Sales Dashboard â€“ Mavyn Toys

Imagine you're a Business Intelligence Analyst working for a nationwide toy store chain called **Mavyn Toys**.  

Recently, the **Supervisor of Regional Sales Managers** noticed that some stores have been struggling with **stock issues** due to inventory shortages. That's when you get called in to **investigate the data** and build an insightful **dashboard**. The goal? Help each Regional Sales Manager **track trends, monitor product performance**, and identify **potential lost revenue** in their area.  

The dashboard will be **reviewed monthly** as part of the Regional Sales Strategy Meetings.  

And *thatâ€™s* how this dashboard came to life! âœ¨
